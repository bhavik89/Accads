<h3>Working on project's API and HomePage design</h3>
    <p>Spent a very hectic week in preparation of internship interviews and other 
        assignments. Didn&#39;t gave much time to work on project but eventually did some 
        good research on project and homepage design</p>
    <p>Tried to combine both the API&#39;s (Google places and Store Locator) but it seems 
        very tedious job to do it. Instead tryin to build the functionalities in store 
        locator api on my own using the Google Places API.</p>
    <p>Frustated by not working of APIs, decided to do some of html and css for Home 
        page. Designed a basic homepage layout for the project, although would have to 
        add more functionalities later on.</p>
