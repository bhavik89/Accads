<h3>Time to think about and work on project!!</h3>
    <p>It&#39;s already too late and still haven&#39;t decided upon the final project. Thought 
        of some kool project ideas but need to discuss it with the professor.</p>
    <p>Also, side by side experimenting about some of the ideas so as to get confidence 
        about the project :)</p>
