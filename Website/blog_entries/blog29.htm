<h3>Tweeking experiments for project</h3>
<p>Fixex the bug pointed out by prof. Rasala for rendering all the places on map. 
Initially the Map didn't show all the places it found, the user had to drag for places far then the current location. 
Almost fixed this issue by calculating the max distance of a place from current location and rendering the whole area. </p>

<p>Also added pagination to view more places found, initially it only showed 20 places, now a user can view upto 60 places searched.</p>

<p>Experimented on ASP.net login controls with user right controls and tabbed contents for page to give nice feel on the page ;)</p>
