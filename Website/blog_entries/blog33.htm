<h3>Project Debugging</h3>
<p>Finished with all the project documentations and some of the bug fixes in the project. Hopefully solve the problem of crashing by introducing a simple delay between calling different asynchronous services</p>
<p>Added some code in main javascript in the autocomplete function, to render the reviews and the photos of place at the instant it is searched for.</p>
