<h3>Exploring Google Maps</h3>
    <p>Tried using some APIs for the project. Thought of exprimenting with the Google 
        Maps API with store locator.</p>
    <p>Found this great tutorial on Lynda.com about using Google Maps API for locating 
        places near you. Although, the tutorial didn&#39;t give indepts information about 
        it, it was very helpful in geting the idea.</p>
    <p>Also, the documentation on the on googleapis.com are really well documented and 
        is very helpful. If you find something hard about using Google APIs... Just 
        Google it ;)</p>
