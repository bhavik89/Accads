<h3>Progressing on Project</h3>
<p>Experimented for obtaining the place&#39;s reviews and photos to display on page 
    using the place detail service of theGoogle Places API</p>
    <p>Also, categorised various places based on their types to let user to select the 
        place he wanna visit easily using a simple dropdown menu. Programmed this
