<h3>Solved some bugs</h3>
<p>
Had the chaching problem of the browser, due to which sometimes maps did not rendered on the page. Hopefully solved it by clearing the map's overlay and the places array everytime the resquest or new place is sent.

        Also, faced the problem with using multiple jQuery libraries. Thanks to TA 
        Dhruvenkumar, for helping me out and solving this major issue. Solved it by 
        using noConflict method of jQuery for comflicting libraries.</p>
