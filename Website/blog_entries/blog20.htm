<h3>Researching on Project</h3>
    <p>Decided to work on the project using Google maps API, discussed the idea with 
        Prof. Rasala.</p>
    <p>However, Professor pointed out some serious pitfalls in my project idea, thank 
        you professor for letting me know well before starting to work on it and it 
        would waste my time.</p>
    <p>Explore the free Google service to find the alternative to it's API, to my surprise Google actually had it's own alternative.</p>
    <p>Also, created a small experiemt on Cookies and Sessions which would be usefuls in the project. Also experiemnt on Master pages</p>
