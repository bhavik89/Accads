<h3>Playing with Direction's services and place details</h3>
    <p>Researched for the get directions link on info window and gettin the directions 
        from the user&#39;s location to the destination. Hopefully Implemented sucessfully 
        on the maps. Although sometimes it gives worng path for the input address 
        matching with another same address.</p>
    <p>I think, I will have to reasearch on this more and possibly get the solution.</p>
