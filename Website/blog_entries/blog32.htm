<h3>Final touches to project</h3>
<p>
Although had mostly solved the problem of rendering the map on site, encountered the project again on another PC. Made changes in the maps callback function, but still the problem persits on some PC. The only way to render maps smoothly is by clearing the browser's cache.
</p>
<p>Made changes in experiments by removing the .aspx.cs files from them and the site server</p>
<p>Retouched the CSS to make it more effective and done with most of the documentation of the project.</p>
