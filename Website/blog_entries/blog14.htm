<h3>Experimenting on ASP.NET and C#...</h3>
    <p>Wished to use all the stuff learnt in one experiment and created a simple and 
        small experiment to combine ASP.NET, C# and jQuery.</p>
    <p>More to explore in C# and asp.net. Tried to integrate Database but something 
        seems wrong. Have to go through the steps mentioned by professor very carefully.</p>
