<h3 class="style1"><em>Project Database</em></h3><hr />
    <p class="style2">The project uses one database table for maintaining the entires of reviews posted 
        by site user and another for maintaining the login in details of the site users. 
    </p>
    <p class="style2">The reviews database has the entires of Username, reviews posted by user and the 
        time property of the reviews that are posted. The login database is created 
        using ASP.net Login controls.</p>
    <p class="style2"><em>How this is done:</em></p>
    <p class="style2">The reviews database is a SQL databse using&nbsp; LINQ to SQL. Every time an 
        authenticated user posts the reviews, it is inserted into the database as well 
        as it is shown in the reviews box. Each the page is loaded, the database is 
        iterated for every user&#39;s reviews and displayed in the reviews space.</p>
    <p class="style2">Login control on the website is setup in such a way that it uses SQL database to 
        store user credentials, roles, memberships and profile details of the user. 
        Every time user enters the username and password and click submit button, the 
        credentials are validated against the data stored in the database tables and if 
        it matches, user is redirected to the page where user clicked the login button.</p>
