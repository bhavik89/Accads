<h3 class="style1"><em>Getting Directions to the place</em></h3><hr />
    <p class="style2">The Get Directions utility allows user to get the driving 
        directions to the place on map for the provided location. The user needs to 
        input the address from where he/she wants to find the directions to given place 
        on the map.</p>
    <p class="style2">To get directions to a place on map, user needs to select place on 
        map by clicking the corresponding marker on map which will pop-up an info. 
        window giving the details of place. The user has to input the address in the 
        text field on marker info-window from where he/she wants to travel to the given 
        place and hit the Go! button on the info-window.</p>
    <p class="style2">Directions are displayed as a polyline drawing the route on the 
        map, as well as the description is printed on the directions panel on the left.</p>
    <p class="style2"><em>How do we get the directions:</em></p>
    <p class="style2">The Get Direction utility uses the direction service of the Google 
        Maps API. This is an asynchronous service by the Goolge Maps API as it needs 
        make a call to the external server. The Get Direction utility takes two 
        locations viz. start and end. Upon requesting the direction, an array of 
        possible routes is obtained and the best route is displayed.</p>
