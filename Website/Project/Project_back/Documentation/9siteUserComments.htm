<p class="style3">The site allows the Logged in users to post their reviews about the places they 
    have been to. The active users can post there comments and views about the 
    places they liked and want to share there experience. The site user reviews are 
    open to all to read but only the authenticated users can post the reviews.</p>

        at the top menu bar. This will take the user to the login form where you need to 
        input the credentials. Once the you are authenticated, you can post the reviews 
        about the place. Note that a blank comment wont be posted.</p>
    <p class="style3"><em>How this is Done:</em></p>
    <p class="style3">There is a reviews database using LINQ to SQL. Every time an authenticated user 
        posts the reviews, it is inserted into the database as well as it is shown in 
        the reviews box. Each the page is loaded, the database is iterated for every 
        user&#39;s reviews and displayed in the reviews space at the bottom-left of the 
        page.</p>
