<h3>Working on alternate API</h3>
<p>Working whole night and found that google Places API provided almost accurate data in JSON. 
Went through some JSON tutorials to learn the basics of it as well as to parse it to extract the required Info.</p>
<p>Created the key for new API but was useless as it had the access policy issues and could not use to test it locally :(</p>
<p>Found another API of google using the places library and was available freely :). Created an experiment to find out its usefulness in project. 
Hope it would help me and I would not have to look out for another alternative.</p>
