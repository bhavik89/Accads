<h3>Combined the services of Google API</h3>
    <p>Used different approach to solve the conflicts between the different services 
        provided the the API.</p>
    <p>Also, introduced AJAX calls and marker animation to make it user interactive and 
        give a better feel. Also coded for opening the info wondow on maps when the user 
        hovers over the place info. in the panel. Now i&#39;ll have to research on get 
        direction service provided by the google maps API to make it more interactive 
        and user friendly ;)</p>
