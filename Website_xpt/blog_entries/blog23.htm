    <h3>Exploring more of Google Places API</h3>
        <p>Went through the documentation of the Google places library to search out more 
            services that can be useful for the user and make the site interactive.</p>
        <p>Explored the textSearch and autocomplete&nbsp; services of provided by the API. 
            Tried hard to combine both the services, however could not due to some errors 
            and conflics in both the services. Experimented the AutoComplete service. Seems 
            to provide good results and would be helpfun in project.</p>
