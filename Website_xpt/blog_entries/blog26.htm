<h3>Adding more Google services to project and experimenting on cool effects</h3>
    <p>I had decided to give the users the reviews of the places the want to visit and 
        photos of the same. Just found that google Place Details API service gives both 
        of it. Just have to get them and present it on the page. Need to work on this
    </p>
    <p>So, if I am adding the photos, I decided to used the some cool effects to display 
        it. Experimented on the jQuery fancy box to give the cool photo sliding effects.</p>
