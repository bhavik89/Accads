<h3>Designing Home page!!</h3>

    <p>
        Finally after slogging whole day and experimenting stupid things and crawling 
        through thousands webpages including 2012 and 2013 websites, got my basic home 
        page&nbsp; ready!!</p>
    <p>
        Although, it needs many changes, but got the idea of CSS, HTML and more 
        importantly the use of &lt;div&gt; tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lot more to learn !!</p>
