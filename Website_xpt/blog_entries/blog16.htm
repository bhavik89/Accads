<h3>Playing with LINQ</h3>
<p>Went through the steps given by prof. Rasala to set up LINQ connection, it&#39;s easy 
    but you need to be careful while following the steps and DO NOT attempt to do 
    what the tutorial says not to do, else you can end messing up with your site!!</p>
    <p>Created an experiment for the login for using SQL and LINQ to authenticate user 
        to SignUp and SignIn. Took the references form the senoir&#39;s site and tweeked 
        the code.</p>
